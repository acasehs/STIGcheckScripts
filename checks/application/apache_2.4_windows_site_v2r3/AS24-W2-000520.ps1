.SYNOPSIS
    STIG Check: V-214379
    Severity: medium

.DESCRIPTION
    Rule Title: The Apache web server must generate a session ID using as much of the character set as possible to reduce the risk of brute force.
    STIG ID: AS24-W2-000520
    Rule ID: SV-214379r1043181

    Generating a session identifier (ID) that is not easily guessed through brute force is essential to deter several types of session attacks. By knowing the session ID, an attacker can hijack a user session that has already been user authenticated by the hosted application. The attacker does not need to guess user identifiers and passwords or have a secure token since the user session has already been authenticated.

By generating session IDs that contain as much of the character set as possible,

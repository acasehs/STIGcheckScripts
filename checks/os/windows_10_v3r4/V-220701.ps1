# STIG Check: V-220701
# STIG ID: WN10-00-000025
# Severity: medium
# Rule Title: Windows 10 must employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: Continuously, where ESS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by ESS; and annually, for external scans by Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP).
#
# Description:
# An approved tool for continuous network scanning must be installed and configured to run.

Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws.

To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using ESS and periodic scanning using other tools, as specif

# Tool Priority: PowerShell (1st priority) > Python (fallback) > third-party (if required)
# Exit Codes: 0=PASS, 1=FAIL, 2=N/A, 3=ERROR

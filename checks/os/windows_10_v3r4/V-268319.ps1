# STIG ID: WN10-CC-000063
# Severity: medium
# Rule Title: Windows 10 systems must use either Group Policy or an approved Mobile Device Management (MDM) product to enforce STIG compliance.
#
# Description:
# Without Windows 10 systems being managed, devices could be rogue and become targets of an attacker.
#
# Tool Priority: PowerShell (1st priority) > Python (fallback) > third-party (if required)
# Exit Codes: 0=PASS, 1=FAIL, 2=N/A, 3=ERROR

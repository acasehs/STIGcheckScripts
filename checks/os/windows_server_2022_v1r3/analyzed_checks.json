The longer an established session is in progress, the more time an attacker has to hijack the session, implement a means to passively intercept data, or compromise any protections on client access. For example, if an attacker gains control of a client computer, an existing (already authenticated) session with the directory server could allow access to the directory. The lack of confidentiality protection in LDAP-based sessions increases exposure to this vulnerability.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109",

The impact of missing audit data is related to the type of object. A failure to capture audit data for objects used by identification, authentication, or authorization functions could degrade or eliminate the ability to track changes to access policy for systems or data. \n\nFor Active Directory (AD), there are a number of critical object types in the domain naming context of the AD database for which auditing is essential. This includes the RID Manager$ object. Because changes to these objects can significantly impact access controls or the availability of systems, the absence of auditing data makes it impossible to identify the source of changes that impact the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems throughout an AD domain.

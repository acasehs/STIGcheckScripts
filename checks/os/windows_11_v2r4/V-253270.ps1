# STIG Check: V-253270
# STIG ID: WN11-00-000075
# Severity: medium
# Rule Title: Only accounts responsible for the backup operations must be members of the Backup Operators group.
#
# Description:
# Backup Operators are able to read and write to any file in the system, regardless of the rights assigned to it. Backup and restore rights permit users to circumvent the file access restrictions present on NTFS disk drives for backup and restore purposes. Members of the Backup Operators group must have separate logon accounts for performing backup duties.
#
# Tool Priority: PowerShell (1st priority) > Python (fallback) > third-party (if required)
# Exit Codes: 0=PASS, 1=FAIL, 2=N/A, 3=ERROR

# STIG Check: V-253491
# STIG ID: WN11-UR-000070
# Severity: medium
# Rule Title: The "Deny access to this computer from the network" user right on workstations must be configured to prevent access from highly privileged domain accounts and local accounts on domain systems and unauthenticated access on all systems.
#
# Description:
# Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Deny access to this computer from the network" right defines the accounts that are prevented from logging on from the network.

In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.

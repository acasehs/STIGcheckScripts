STIG Check: V-253258
STIG ID: WN11-00-000025
Severity: medium
Rule Title: Windows 11 must employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency: Continuously, where ESS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network scans not covered by ESS; and annually, for external scans by Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP).

Description:
An approved tool for continuous network scanning must be installed and configured to run.

Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws.

To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using ESS and periodic scanning using other tools, as specif

Tool Priority: PowerShell (1st priority) > Python (2nd priority/fallback) > third-party (if required)

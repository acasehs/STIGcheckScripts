    "discussion": "Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions using a database management system (DBMS). Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.\n\nThe capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.\n\nThe organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, two might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.\n\n(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)"

    "discussion": "To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be individually identified and authenticated.\n\nA shared authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a shared authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a shared authenticator is the Unix OS \"root\" user account, a Windows \"administrator\" account, a \"SA\" account, or a \"helpdesk\" account.\n\nFor example, the Unix and Windows operating systems offer a \"switch user\" capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, switch to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a shared authenticator.\n\nSome applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a shared authenticator, this requirement will apply.\n\nThere may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.\n\nWhen shared accounts are used without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.\n\nOracle Access Manager may be helpful in meeting this requirement.\n\nOracle Access Manager is used when there is a need for multifactor authentication of applications front-ending Oracle Datasets that may use group accounts. Oracle Access Manager supports using PKI-based smart cards (CAC, PIV) for multifactor authentication. When a user authenticates to a smart card application, the smart card engine produces a certificate-based authentication token. Can configure a certificate-based authentication scheme in Oracle Access Manager that uses information from the smart card certificate. Certificate-based authentication works with any smart card or similar device that presents an X.509 certificate."

Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.\n\nCheck to verify what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.\n\nTo view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information that can be used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:\n\n$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\nFor example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\nThe wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding username (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\nConfiguring Clients to Use the External Password Store:\n\nIf the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows built-in authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\nFor clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\nIf wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:\n\n1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -create\n\nFor example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -create\nEnter password: password\n\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\nThe mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\nEnter password: password\n\nFor example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system\nEnter password: password\n\nIn this specification, the wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network.

Document the need for it, who uses it, and any relevant mitigations, and obtain AO approval.\n2. Train all users of the tool in the importance of not using the plain-text password option and in how to keep the password hidden.\n\nConsider wrapping the startup command with a shell or wrapper and using an Oracle external password store.\n\nOracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.\n\nCheck to verify what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.\n\nTo view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:\n\n$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\nFor example:\n\n$ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\nThe wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding username (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\nConfiguring Clients to Use the External Password Store\n\nIf the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\nFor clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\nIf wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:\n\n1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:\norapki create -wallet wallet_location -auto_login_local\n\nFor example:\norapki wallet create -wallet c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -auto_login_local\nEnter password: password\n\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\nThe mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\nEnter password: password\n\nFor example:\nmkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system\nEnter password: password\n\nIn this specification:\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command.\n\nThe db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on Unix systems and in ORACLE_HOME\\network\\admin on Windows.\n\nThe username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.\n\n3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1. For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and the Oracle home is set to /private/ora12, then need to enter the following into the client sqlnet.ora file:\n\nWALLET_LOCATION =\n(SOURCE =\n(METHOD = FILE)\n(METHOD_DATA =\n(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)\n)\n)\n\n4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\nSQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\nThis setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.\n\nWhen external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a username and password.

However, in cases where the DBMS controls the interaction, this requirement applies.\n\nTo prevent the compromise of authentication information such as passwords and PINs during the authentication process, the feedback from the system must not provide any information that would allow an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism. \n\nObfuscation of user-provided authentication secrets when typed into the system is a method used in addressing this risk. \n\nDisplaying asterisks when a user types in a password or a smart card PIN is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication secrets.\n\nThis requires reviewing applications, which will involve collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered."

Check the DDL for the tables that are created for the applications to verify constraints have been enabled.\n\nEnabling Constraints Upon Definition: The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:\nCREATE TABLE emp (\nempno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY, . . . ) ;\nALTER TABLE emp\nADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because existing rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. In this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.\n\nWhen enabling a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, an associated index is created.  \n\nFor details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, refer to the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.\n\nDisabling Constraints: To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:\n\n- When loading large amounts of data into a table;\n\n- When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number); or\n\n- When importing or exporting one table at a time.\n\nIn all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.\n\nIt is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.\n\nEnabling Constraints: While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.\n\nCan identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. Refer to \"Reporting Constraint Exceptions\". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which can be examined.\n\nENABLE, NOVALIDATE Constraint State: When a constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with ENABLE, NOVALIDATE constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Constraints in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.\n\nEnabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint NOVALIDATE is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating reduces the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.\n\nEfficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure:\nUsing integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:\n- Disable state.\n- Perform the operation (load, export, import).\n- ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state.\n- Enable state.\n\nSome benefits of using constraints in this order are:\n- No locks are held.\n- All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.\n- Constraint enabling is done in parallel.\n- Concurrent activity on table is permitted.\n\nSetting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition: When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by the specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.\n\nDisabling Constraints Upon Definition: The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:\n\nCREATE TABLE emp (\nempno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE, . . . ;\n\nALTER TABLE emp\nADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.\n\nEnabling Constraints Upon Definition:\n\nThe following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:\n\nCREATE TABLE emp (\nempno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY, . . . ;\n\nALTER TABLE emp\nADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. If this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.",
    "discussion": "Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application's data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nAll applications need to validate the data users attempt to input to the application for processing. Rules for checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.\n\nThis requires for inspection of application source code, which will involve collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.\n\nOracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints.\n\nIntegrity Constraint States can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE).

If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.\n\nAdditionally, can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE).

Forcing users to change from a non-privileged account to a privileged account when operating on the web server or on security-relevant information forces users to only operate as a web server administrator when necessary. Operating in this manner allows for better logging of changes and better forensic information and limits accidental changes to the web server."

This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109"

    "discussion": "Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.\n\nDetecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's information system security manager (ISSM)/information system security officer (ISSO) and SAs must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.\n\nNotifications provided by information systems include messages to local computer consoles and/or hardware indications, such as lights.\n\nThis capability must take into account operational requirements for availability for selecting an appropriate response. The organization may choose to shut down or restart the information system upon security function anomaly detection.\n\nOL 8 comes with many optional software packages, including the file integrity tool Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE). This requirement assumes the use of AIDE; however, a different tool may be used if the requirements are met. Note that AIDE does not have a configuration that will send a notification, so a cron job is recommended that uses the mail application on the system to email the results of the file integrity check.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000363-GPOS-00150, SRG-OS-000446-GPOS-00200, SRG-OS-000447-GPOS-00201"

This package provides the \"vlock\" binary, a utility used to lock one or several user virtual console sessions.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000028-GPOS-00009, SRG-OS-000030-GPOS-00011"

Upon restoration of the connection to the centralized collection server, action should be taken to synchronize the local audit data with the collection server."

    "discussion": "Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.\n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\n\nOL 9 uses /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of \"ClientAliveInterval\" and \"ClientAliveCountMax\" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \"ClientAliveInterval\" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, SSHD will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \"ClientAliveCountMax\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without SSHD receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, SSHD will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109, SRG-OS-000395-GPOS-00175"

For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter.

This option enforces the default configuration in Office. This option also allows users to potentially enable unsigned/untrusted macros. If a site requires the use of macros, they must be signed/approved and added to appropriate locations listed in the Trust Center Settings. \n- Disable all except digitally signed macros: The application displays the Trust Bar for digitally signed macros, allowing users to enable them or leave them disabled. Any unsigned macros are disabled, and users are not notified.\n- Disable all without notification: The application disables all macros, whether signed or unsigned, and does not notify users.\n- Enable all macros (not recommended): All macros are enabled, whether signed or unsigned. This option can significantly reduce security by allowing dangerous code to run undetected.\n\nIf this policy setting is disabled, \"Disable all with notification\" will be the default setting.\n\nIf this policy setting is not configured, when users open files in the specified applications that contain VBA macros, the applications open the files with the macros disabled and display the Trust Bar with a warning that macros are present and have been disabled. Users can inspect and edit the files if appropriate, but cannot use any disabled functionality until they enable it by clicking \"Enable Content\" on the Trust Bar.

    "Discussion": "This policy setting specifies the Microsoft ActiveX initialization security level for all Microsoft Office applications. ActiveX controls can adversely affect a computer directly. In addition, malicious code can be used to compromise an ActiveX control and attack a computer. \n\nTo indicate the safety of an ActiveX control, developers can denote them as Safe for Initialization (SFI). SFI indicates that a control is safe to open and run, and that it is not capable of causing a problem for any computer, regardless of whether it has persisted data values or not. If a control is not marked SFI, it is possible that the control could adversely affect a computer--or it could mean that the developers did not test the control in all situations and are not sure whether it might be compromised in the future. If you enable this policy setting, you can set the ActiveX security level to a number between 1 and 6. These security levels are as follows:\n \n1. Regardless of how the control is marked, load it and use the persisted values (if any). This setting does not prompt the user. \n\n2. If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, load in unsafe mode with persisted values (if any), or use the default (first-time initialization) settings. This level is similar to the default configuration, but does not prompt the user. \n\n3. If SFI, load the control in unsafe mode and use persisted values (if any). If not SFI, prompt the user and advise them that it is marked unsafe. If the user chooses No at the prompt, do not load the control. Otherwise, load it with default (first-time initialization) settings. \n\n4. If SFI, load the control in safe mode and use persisted values (if any).

    "Discussion": "This policy setting allows the user to control how ActiveX controls in UserForms should be initialized based upon whether they are Safe for Initialization (SFI) or Unsafe for Initialization (UFI). \n \nActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as SFI, which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a computer, or the developers may not have tested the control in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date. SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful ways when safety was not important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked UFI, which means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are always loaded in unsafe mode. \n \nIf this policy setting is enabled, choose from four options for loading controls in UserForms: \n \n1. For a UFI or SFI signed control that supports safe and unsafe mode, load the control in unsafe mode. For an SFI signed control that only supports a safe mode configuration, load the control in safe mode. This option enforces the default configuration. \n \n2. Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: \n \n- For a UFI signed control, if users respond \"Yes\" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond \"No\", load the control using the default properties. \n- For an SFI signed control that supports both safe and unsafe modes, if users respond \"Yes\" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond \"No\", load the control using safe mode. If the SFI control can only support safe mode, load the control in safe mode. This option is the default configuration in the Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus release. \n \n3. Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt, loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI: \n \n- For a UFI signed control, if users respond \"Yes\" to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond \"No\", load the control with its default properties. \n- For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode. \n \n4. For a UFI signed control, load with the default properties of the control. For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode (considered to be the safest mode). \n \nIf  this policy setting is disabled or not configured, the behavior is as if this policy setting is enabled and then select option \"1\".",

    "Discussion": "This policy setting controls the security level for macros in Outlook. \n\nIf you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling macros in Outlook: \n- Always warn. This option corresponds to the \"Warnings for all macros\" option in the \"Macro Security\" section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled. \n- Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the \"No warnings and disable all macros\" option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users. \n- Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the \"Warnings for signed macros; all unsigned macros are disabled\" option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows: \n--If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher. \n--If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future. \n--If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location. \nThis option is the default configuration in Outlook. \n- No security check. This option corresponds to the \"No security check for macros (Not recommended)\" option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended. \n\nIf you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of Enabled -- Warning for signed, disable unsigned.",

Users are also prevented from adding new network locations to the Trusted Locations list in the Trust Center.
